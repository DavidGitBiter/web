Student and aspiring researcher interested in interfacing informatics and computational tools with transcriptomics and proteomics data.
Born in the city of portalegre, David grew up close to the portuguese mediterranean countryside which fostered a love for the natural world. With interest in the life sciences
he proceded to study a Bachelors in biology in the University of Évora. It was in these classes that he realised an interest in the elements of gene expression, proteomics, and
the use of informatics and computational tools applied to the life sciences, which paved the way for a masters in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology in the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon, where he is currently developing his thesis.
